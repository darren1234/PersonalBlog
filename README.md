My personal take on creating a blog page

This will be a page for myself to highlight development as I progress.  It will also allow me to formulate a decent approach to creating blog sites in the future.

First thoughts on the blog page will be to have a header navagation bar, and also a footer navagation bar that remains constant, with all information and blogs contained in a central container.  The header bar will contain quick links like 'About', 'Contact', 'Home'?, etc.  The footer bar will be a quick reference to find the page the user is looking for.
